# Structural Model of MSR-V

MSR-V makes reasoning structure explicit through a small set
of independent structural axes.

## Structural Axes (DROS)

- **D — Definition**: entities and their attributes
- **R — Relation**: dependencies and logical connections
- **O — Operation**: actions, transformations, negations
- **S — System**: domain context and boundary conditions

Separating these axes allows MSR-V to detect conflicts
that fluent text often conceals.

## V-Axis Structural Energy Model

Each axis is assigned a qualitative **structural-energy** tag:

- **UNIQUE** — strong structural presence
- **LATENT** — partial or contextual presence
- **OFF** — minimal or absent presence

These tags reflect **structural completeness**,  
not semantic correctness or factual truth.

## Shape Classification

The number of active (non-OFF) axes forms a discrete shape:

- **POINT**: 1 axis active
- **LINE**: 2 axes active
- **TRIANGLE**: 3 axes active
- **SQUARE**: 4 axes active

Shape provides a qualitative measure of reasoning dimensionality.

## Structural States (State-4)

MSR-V diagnoses reasoning into four qualitative structural states:

- **Harmony** — fully coherent
- **Alignment** — coherent on critical axes
- **Divergence** — exploratory but unstable
- **Fracture** — structurally broken despite surface fluency

**Fracture does not imply factual error.**  
It indicates internal structural inconsistency.

State classification is **diagnostic**, not a confidence score.

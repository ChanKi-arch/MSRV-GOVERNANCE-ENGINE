# Evaluation and Benchmarking Notes

All benchmarks associated with MSR-V are
**illustrative observations**, not performance claims.

They demonstrate how structural diagnosis
affects routing behavior under controlled conditions.

---

## What Benchmarks Show

- Sensitivity of routing to structural complexity
- Domain-dependent execution patterns
- Cost and latency effects of avoiding unnecessary reasoning

---

## What Benchmarks Do Not Claim

- Model accuracy
- Factual correctness
- Superiority over other systems
- Real-world deployment readiness

MSR-V benchmarks evaluate **governance behavior**, not intelligence.

No benchmark in this repository should be interpreted
as a claim of production readiness.

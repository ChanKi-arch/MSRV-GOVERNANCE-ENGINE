# Governance Philosophy of MSR-V

MSR-V is designed around a simple premise:

> **Reasoning failures are often architectural, not probabilistic.**

Modern AI systems optimize token likelihoods and surface fluency,
but lack explicit governance over reasoning structure itself.

MSR-V exists to fill that architectural gap.

## Knowledge, Insight, and Wisdom as an Architectural Analogy

To clarify the scope of MSR-V, we adopt an architectural circuit analogy:

- **Knowledge** corresponds to components:  
  discrete facts, rules, or learned representations.

- **Insight** corresponds to placement:  
  selecting and arranging components within a given context.

- **Wisdom** corresponds to design:  
  defining the governing architecture that constrains how components interact.

MSR-V operates primarily at the level of **architectural design**.

It does not aim to add new components (knowledge),
nor to optimize placement heuristics alone (insight).

Instead, MSR-V defines **structural governance rules**
that constrain, route, and control reasoning behavior as a system-level process.

## What MSR-V Is — and Is Not

### MSR-V Is
- A reasoning governance layer
- A white-box structural diagnostic system
- A deterministic controller of reasoning execution depth
- A cost, latency, and risk management layer

### MSR-V Is Not
- A language model
- A fact-checking engine
- A semantic truth oracle
- A replacement for LLMs

MSR-V does not judge whether an answer is true.  
It governs whether a **reasoning process is structurally justified to run**.

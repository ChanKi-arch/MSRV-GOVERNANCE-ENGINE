# MSR-V Architecture Overview

**MSR-V** is a white-box **architectural governance layer**  
that diagnoses structural fractures in reasoning  
and routes computation only when necessary.

MSR-V does **not** generate language and does **not** verify factual correctness.  
It governs *when*, *how*, and *how deeply* **reasoning execution** should occur.

At its core, MSR-V reframes many AI failures not as missing knowledge,
but as **misaligned reasoning structure**.

## What MSR-V Controls

MSR-V governs reasoning at an architectural level by controlling:

- Structural coherence across definitions, relations, operations, and system context
- Execution depth through deterministic, interpretable routing
- Cost, latency, and structural risk *before* deep reasoning is executed

MSR-V operates **above** language models and is **model-agnostic by design**.

It complements existing LLMs rather than replacing them.
